<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<div class="info-container"></div>
<div class="info">
  The Sims 4 is a strategic social simulation video game, similar to preceding titles in the series. There is no primary objective or goal to achieve (with the exception of some game packs), and instead of fulfilling objectives, the player is encouraged to make choices and engage fully in an interactive environment. The focus of the games is on the simulated lives of virtual people called "Sims", and the player is responsible for directing their actions, attending to their needs, and helping them attain their desires. Players control their life and explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out. "Simoleon" (ยง) is the unit of currency used in the game. Players can play with pre-existing Sims and families, or create their own.

Sims primarily make money by find a job, or selling crafted items such as paintings and garden produce.[1] Sims need to develop skills for jobs and crafting items, for example, Sims in the Culinary career track need to be proficient in the Cooking skill. Players can place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build their houses using in-game building tools, then furnish the homes with objects from an in-game catalog. Optional add-ons and expansion packs expand the number of features, tools, and objects available to play with.

The game also includes numerous cheat codes; e.g. "motherlode" lets the player add ยง50,000 to a Sim's household, and "bb.moveobjects" lets the player place objects in Build mode without interfering with surrounding objects.

<h3>Create-a-Sim</h3>
<div class="info-container"></div>
<div class="info"> Create-a-Sim is the main interface for creating Sims in The Sims 4, and is significantly changed from previous The Sims games. Sliders for adjusting facial and bodily features are removed, and replaced by direct mouse manipulation. By clicking, dragging, and pulling with the mouse, players may directly manipulate the facial and bodily features of a Sim, such as body parts like the abdomen, chest, legs, arms and feet. However, fitness and fatness levels are still adjusted with sliders. Selections of pre-made designs of Sims are available to choose from, and range in body shape and ethnicity.

Sims have seven life stages: baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult, and elder. All life stages can be created in Create-a-Sim, with the exception of the baby life stage. Toddlers were absent from the original game release, but were added via a patch in 2017.

Each Sim has three personality traits, and an aspiration containing its own special trait. Traits form the personality of a Sim, and significantly affect a Sim's behavior and emotions. Aspirations are lifelong goals for Sims, Sims get a reward trait for completing an aspiration, which gives them an advantage in actions relevant to the aspiration. Sims can also have likes and dislikes that determine aesthetics and activities Sims prefer.

There are hairstyles, with several hair color options, for both male and female Sims. All clothing options are available across all outfits, and players are allowed up to five outfits per category. There is a filter panel where clothing options can be sorted by color, material, outfit category, fashion choice, style, content and packs.

Gender options for Sims were expanded in a 2016 patch, allowing for greater freedom of gender expression. With this update, hairstyles and outfits can be worn by any Sim of any gender, and pregnancy is now possible regardless of gender. The diversity of skin tones in the game was greatly expanded in a 2020 patch. With this update, the skin colors of Sims are set by dividing them into warm, neutral and cold tones, and the transparency and saturation of skin tones and makeup colors can be adjusted to the player's desired color.</div>
