<div class="info">
  The Sims 4 is a strategic social simulation video game, similar to preceding titles in the series. There is no primary objective or goal to achieve (with the exception of some game packs), and instead of fulfilling objectives, the player is encouraged to make choices and engage fully in an interactive environment. The focus of the games is on the simulated lives of virtual people called "Sims", and the player is responsible for directing their actions, attending to their needs, and helping them attain their desires. Players control their life and explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out. "Simoleon" (ยง) is the unit of currency used in the game. Players can play with pre-existing Sims and families, or create their own.

Sims primarily make money by find a job, or selling crafted items such as paintings and garden produce.[1] Sims need to develop skills for jobs and crafting items, for example, Sims in the Culinary career track need to be proficient in the Cooking skill. Players can place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build their houses using in-game building tools, then furnish the homes with objects from an in-game catalog. Optional add-ons and expansion packs expand the number of features, tools, and objects available to play with.

The game also includes numerous cheat codes; e.g. "motherlode" lets the player add ยง50,000 to a Sim's household, and "bb.moveobjects" lets the player place objects in Build mode without interfering with surrounding objects.
